TAPMAKER:

This is a quick and dirty hack originally written for
mymzx - this takes any file and creates a .TAP file for it
- the file contained is of type CODE and loads to address 0.

This tool appends to the end of the specified .TAP file so
watch out!

BIN2TAP:

Creates .TAP file with a very simple BASIC loader at the beginning.
After converting, a LOAD "" is sufficient to run your code !

Warning:  this tool OVERWRITES the specified .TAP file !!!
