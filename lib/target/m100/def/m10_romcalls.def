; Olivetti M10 firmware macros and defs
;
; M100 system ROM aka firmware can be called in atleast a couple of ways
; If we're calling it from OPTROM made with Stephen Adolph's template, we do
; RST 6; DEFW ROM_ADDR
; And if we're calling from normal RAM, then we simply do CALL ROM_ADDR

; With ROMCALL macro, all ROM calls (except RSTs) can be abstracted into
; ROMCALL; DEFW ROM_ADDR
; ...and be conditionally compiled depending on the subtype we use.

	EXTERN	ROMCALL_OP ; it's defined in m100_crt0.asm
#define ROMCALL defb ROMCALL_OP
	
; ROM calls:

#define OPTROM_SIG "AB"
