; Olivetti M10 firmware macros and defs
;
; M100 system ROM aka firmware can be called in atleast a couple of ways
; If we're calling it from OPTROM made with Stephen Adolph's template, we do
; RST 6; DEFW ROM_ADDR
; And if we're calling from normal RAM, then we simply do CALL ROM_ADDR

; With ROMCALL macro, all ROM calls (except RSTs) can be abstracted into
; ROMCALL; DEFW ROM_ADDR
; ...and be conditionally compiled depending on the subtype we use.

	EXTERN	ROMCALL_OP ; it's defined in m100_crt0.asm
#define ROMCALL defb ROMCALL_OP
	
; ROM calls:

defc    POPAFRET = $26A1
defc    OPTROMSIG = $FAAB

defc	KYREAD	= $12D4	; wait for key from the keyboard
defc	KYPEND	= $13E4	; check keyboard queue for pending characters

defc	CLS	= $420D ; clear screen
defc	CHROUT	= $4B12	; print character in reg. A to LCD/printer
defc	CURPOS	= $4258 ; position cursor; H=column (1-40), L=row(1-8)
defc	CURSON	= $4225 ; turn cursor on
defc	CURSOFF	= $422A	; ...and off
defc	BEEP	= $4205	; sound the beeper

defc	LCDSET	= $7166 ; LCD set pixel (D, E)
defc	LCDRES	= $7167 ; LCD reset pixel (D, E)
