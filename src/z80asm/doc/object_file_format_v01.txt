File formats

Object file format
------------------
The structure of the object file format is designed exclusively for 
the Z80 Module Assembler. However, it may be useful for other 
programmers if they wish to use the file format for other purposes. 
We have included the documentation of the object file structure in this 
document. Improvement suggestions are welcome. We hope to have designed 
a simple and straightforward file format. The documentation may be 
necessary if you want to use the object file format in other systems. 

I have created the design structure of the object file format to be 
suitable for future expansion. The primary aim of the design has been to 
maintain structure simplicity and load efficiency during link 
processing. 

The format of the object file is as follows:

0 [ 'Z80RMF01' <ORG Address> ]
  [ <F.ptr to Module Name> ]
  [ <F.ptr to Expression Declarations> ]
  [ <F.ptr to Name Declarations> ]
  [ <F.ptr to Library Name Declarations> ]
  [ <F.ptr to Machine Code Block> ]

  [ <Expression Declaration> ]
  [ ... ] 

  [ <Name Declaration> ] 
  [ ... ]

  [ <Library Name Declaration> ]
  [ ... ]

  [ <Module Name> ]
  [ <Machine Code> ]
n

The 0 (null) - <n> defines start to <n> total of bytes file length. The 
above figure has deliberately been split into sections to clarify the 
file structure, allthough there is no actual physical separation between 
the sections in the file; each section is immediatly followed by the 
next. 

The file pointers are 32bit integers stored in low byte - high byte 
order (Little endian format - Z80/Intel notation). 

* <ORG Address> : Contains the ORG address for the linked machine code 
  or FFFFh for no ORG address defined. 

* <Expression Declaration> : Contains the following: 
  <type><patchptr><length><expression_string>

  <type> defines the resulting evaluation type range: 
  'U': 8bit integer (0 to 255) 
  'S': 8bit signed integer (-128 to 127) 
  'C': 16bit integer (-32768 to 65535) 
  'L': 32bit signed integer

  <patchptr> defines the 16bit relative module code patch pointer to 
  store result.
  <length> defines byte length of expression string. 
  <expression_string> contains the infix expression parsed from the 
  source file.

* <Name Declaration> 
  Contains the following: 
  <Scope><Type><Value><Length><Name>

  <Scope> defines the scope of the name:  
  'L' is local,  
  'G' is global,  
  'X' global library

  <Type> defines whether it is a: 
  'A' relocatable address, 
  'C' a constant'

  <Length> defines length byte of the following <Name> string.


* <Library Name Declaration> 
  Contains the following which defines library reference names: 
  <Length><Name>

  <Length> defines length byte of the following <Name> string.

* <Module Name> 
  Contains a preceeding byte identifying the length of the following 
  string

* <Machine Code> 
  Contains a preceeding 16bit integer identifying the total length of
  the following machine code block.
  If the code block is 65536 bytes long, the length contains 0.


Library file format
-------------------
The library file format is a sequense of object files with additional
structures.

0 [ 'Z80LMF01' ]
  [ <Object File Block> ]
  [ ... ] 
n

* <Object File Block> 
  Contains the following: 
  <Next Object File><Object File Length><'Z80RMF01' Object File>

* <Next Object File> is a 32bit integer file pointer to the next 
  <Object File Block>. If this file pointer is -1 (FFFFFFFFh) then 
  the current <Object File Block> is the last in the library file.

* <Object File Length> is 32bit length integer of the 
  <'Z80RMF01' Object File>. If this integer is 0 then it is indicated 
  that the current <Object File Block> has been marked "deleted" and 
  will not be used.
