- parse #pragma once and IFNDEF / DEFINE guards to skip includes
- add option -M (cout) -MD (.d file) and generate input file for Makefile target.d
- add trim to TokensLine, replace all the scattered trimming from the preprocessor
- Fixed unitended expansion of directives inside macros causing IFDEF SYM to
  be translated to IFDEF 1 on macro expansion.
- Refactoring.
