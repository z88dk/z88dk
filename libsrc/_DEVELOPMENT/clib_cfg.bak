; the library to be built.

defc __CLIB_OPT_MULTITHREAD = 0

; This means:
; 
; * All FILEs are protected by recursive locks.
; * The process heap is protected by a mutex.
;
; Setting to zero will reduce code size and slightly speed
; up execution.
;
; When multi-threading is enabled, the program can still
; bypass locking by calling the _unlocked versions of functions
; but you do so at your own risk if there are synchronization
; issues.
;
; When multi-threading is disabled, there is no difference
; between the _unlocked and regular function entry points.
; However, the locks are still present in the data structures
; and, for example, FILEs can still be locked via flockfile()
; and family.  Note that the stdio functions will not be
; blocked by a lock but the user program can perform its own
; synchronization by using flockfile() and family appropriately.

; cause their integer counterparts to be pulled into the user code.
; This is because the specialized long functions will try to
; perform the conversion using faster 16-bit code when it can.
; In these cases, the library will also use the specialized
; integer function when it is already there even if it is not
; explicitly enabled here.
;
; Note: Some library functions such as printf and scanf may
; use the specialized integer text to decimal conversion
; function directly, in which case enabling that bit will
; result in no additional code size.
