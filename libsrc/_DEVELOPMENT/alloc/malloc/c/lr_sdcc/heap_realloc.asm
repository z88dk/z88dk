; void *heap_realloc(void *heap, void *p, size_t size)
;
; Resize the memory block p to size bytes.  If this cannot
; be done in-place, a new memory block is allocated and the
; data at address p is copied to the new block.
;
; If p == 0, an effective malloc is performed, except a
; successful allocation occurs from the largest block available
; in the heap to allow for further quick growth via realloc.
;
; If p != 0 and size == 0, the block is reduced to zero size
; but is not freed.  You must call free to free blocks.
;
; If successful, returns ptr to the reallocated memory block,
; which may be p if the block was resized in place.
;
; If unsuccessful, returns 0 with carry set.
