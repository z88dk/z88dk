# COPPER USER CONFIGURATION
# rebuild the library if changes are made
#

# The ZXN Copper is an independent device operating in parallel
# with the cpu whose timing is tied to the video display generation.
# Nominally it operates at 7Mhz with each copper instruction
# taking the same amount of time as the movement of the raster by
# one horizontal pixel.
#
# Vertically the display consists of 264 lines in 60Hz mode and
# 312 lines in 50Hz mode.  Lines 0-191 always correspond to the
# area containing the active display.  In 60Hz mode, the next 32
# lines are bottom border, 8 lines for Vsync, and 32 lines for top
# border.  In 50Hz mode, the next 56 lines are bottom border, 8
# lines for Vsync and 56 lines for top border.
#
# Horizontally the display is the same in 50 or 60Hz mode.  It
# consists of 448 pixels (0-447) or, grouped eight pixels at
# a time, as 56 characters (0-55).  The first 256 pixels (0-255)
# or 32 characters (0-31) contain the active display.  The next
# 64 pixels are the right border, then 96 pixels for horizontal
# blanking and 32 pixels for the left border.

# The ZXN Copper understands two operations:
#
# (1) Wait for a particular line (0-311 @ 50Hz or 0-261 @ 60Hz)
#     and a horizontal character position (0-55)
#
# (2) Write a value to a nextreg.
#
# These operations are encoded into a 16-bit instruction which
# is stored in big endian form.  The Copper has a 1k code space
# on the fpga, which means an instruction space of 512 instructions.
#
# Programming the Copper involves writing zeroes to nextreg 97 & 98
# to turn off the Copper and set the current instruction index to zero.
# Then the program is loaded into the Copper by writing bytes to
# nextreg 96.  Once that's done, the Copper can be switched on in
# one of three modes as indicated for nextreg 98 below.

# NEXTREG 96: Copper Data
#
# define(`__REG_COPPER_DATA', 96)

# NEXTREG 97: Copper Control Lo
#
# define(`__REG_COPPER_CONTROL_LO', 97)

# NEXTREG 98: Copper Control Hi
#
# define(`__REG_COPPER_CONTROL_HI', 98)
# define(`__RCCH_COPPER_STOP', 0x00)
# define(`__RCCH_COPPER_RUN_ONCE', 0x40)
# define(`__RCCH_COPPER_RUN_LOOP', 0x80)
# define(`__RCCH_COPPER_RUN_ON_INTERRUPT', 0xc0)

# For modes RUN_ONCE and RUN_ON_INTERRUPT, the Copper program
# should be terminated by a stop instruction (wait for a
# non-existent line).  For RUN_LOOP, the Copper continuously
# executes all instructions in its 1k memory, looping from
# the end back to the beginning.  If the instruction list is
# less than 1k, it should be padded with nops (a write of 0
# to nextreg 0) which will each take one pixel in time to
# execute.  More advanced applications can have the dma stream
# new instructions into the copper as it executes so that the
# instruction space is effectively larger than 1k.
