; 'arghak' takes the first 7 args on the stack
; and places them contiguously at the "args" ram area.
; This allows a library routine to make one call	to arghak
; and henceforth have all it's args available directly
; through lhld's instead of having to hack the stack as it
; grows and shrinks. Note that arghak should be called as the
; VERY FIRST THING a function does, before even pushing BC.
