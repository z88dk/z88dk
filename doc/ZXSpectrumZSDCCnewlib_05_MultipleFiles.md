# ZX Spectrum Development with Z88DK - Multiple Files

This is the fifth document in the series which describes how to get started
writing ZX Spectrum programs using Z88DK. As before, it concerns itself only
with the newer, more standards compilant zsdcc C compiler. Neither the original
sccz80 compiler nor the classic library is discussed.

## Assumptions

It is assumed the reader has worked through the earlier installments of this
series and is continuing on from [installment 4](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_04_InputDevices.md).

If you would like to jump to the beginning, click on [installment 1](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_01_GettingStarted.md).

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the idea of linking object files
together within the context of a C program.

The reader is also assumed to be familiar with the concept and basic content of
a Z80 assembly language file.

## Multiple C Source Files

So far in this series of articles we've only ever had examples consisting of a
simple piece of code within a single C source file. That's not realistic for any
project of any size, so we need to look at how we can break our source into
multiple files.

This is going to be a brief introduction. Using multiple files isn't complicated
with Z88DK, and the nuances and caveats that there are won't be discussed
here. We simply introduce the concept so the reader can see how to keep their
build clear and understandable as it gets bigger.

As always, we start simple. Here's a source file containing a main() function:

```
/* C source start */

#include <stdio.h>

extern unsigned char message[];

int main()
{
  printf("Message is: \"%s\"\n", message);

  return 0;
}

/* C source end */
```

Save that into a file called text_main.c, then save this into a file called
text_data.c:

```
/* C source start */

unsigned char message[] = "Hello, world!";

/* C source end */
```

To compile both files and link them together into the final application just
give both file names on the compile line:

```
zcc +zx -vn -startup=0 -clib=sdcc_iy text_main.c text_data.c -o text -create-app
```

Both files will be compiled each time the application is built. We're not going
to look at Makefiles here, although zsdcc can be slow so you should plan to use
one for any sizeable project.

### Project Lists

Two filenames on the command line isn't a problem, but as a project gets bigger
and the list of its files gets longer it becomes more convenient to put those
filenames into a single list file and use that on the command line instead.

Create a file called text.lst containing these lines:

```
text_main.c
text_data.c
```

and compile with the list file, indicated by the preceding '@' symbol:

```
zcc +zx -vn -startup=0 -clib=sdcc_iy @text.lst -o text -create-app
```

It does what you'd expect. You can use filenames containing subdirectory names,
so you can break your build up into subdirectories as required.

You can also add list files into list files by using the same '@' symbol, so
your first list file might contain:

```
game_code.c
@data/data.lst
```

That's one C file and a second list file in the data/ subdirectory. The
data/data.lst file might contain:

```
graphics_data.c
music_data.c
text_data.c
```

All the data files listed in data/data.lst would be compiled and linked with
game_code.c as you'd expect.

## Adding Z80 Assembly Language

This guide isn't the place to introduce Z80 assembly language or how it can be
used with Z88DK, but we can demonstrate how to bring a Z80 assembly language
file into our build. In fact, since the zcc front end tool knows how to deal
with assembly language files it's quite trivial.

Copy this assembly language into a file called text_data.asm:

```
SECTION rodata_user

PUBLIC _message

_message:

defb 0x48, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f, 0x20, 0x41, 0x53, 0x4D, 0x00
```

Build the application with:

```
zcc +zx -vn -startup=0 -clib=sdcc_iy text_main.c text_data.asm -o text -create-app
```

The zcc tool recognises the ASM file and knows it has to be passed to the
assembler, as opposed to the C compiler. Once assembled, zcc links the assembly
language into the application and makes its contents available to the C code.

### Where To Go From Here

This has been a brief introduction to the ability of zcc to handle multiple
files and file types all in one build. We've scratched the surface and
demonstrated a couple of useful features of zcc. It's a powerful and flexible
tool which is worth exploring, and is documented
[here](https://www.z88dk.org/wiki/doku.php?id=zcc)
