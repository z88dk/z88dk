Notes on the CPC target
=======================


Floating Point Support
----------------------

The CPC target supports a native maths library, this is selected using the 
-lmz switch when compiling.

The library that is linked in by default supports 3 models of CPC - CPC464,
CPC664 and CPC6128. Should memory be in short supply and you wish to compile
for a specific CPC then you can do the following:

zcc +cpc [...] -lmz -l6128_math

or -l664_math or -l664_math which will save about 600 bytes of memory.

The native CPC library supports some additional functions, these are:

void deg();

Switch the FP engine into degrees mode

void rad();

Switch the FP engine into radians mode

double pi();

Return the value of pi.

double pow10(int x);

Returns 10^x


Application Creation
--------------------

The appmake has been updated to support the CPC as a target. When compiling
if you supply the -create-app flag then a file with the suffix .cpc is
generated. This file contains a CPC disc file header which can then be 
easily transferred onto a CPC disc using cpcfs or a similar tool.
