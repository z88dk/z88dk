# The ZX Spectrum Programmer's Z88DK Getting Started Guide

The *ZX Spectrum Programmer's Z88DK Getting Started Guide* consists of a series
of documents written to assist Spectrum developers who want to write programs in
'C' using the Z88DK development toolset. The reader is expected to know the 'C'
programming language, but otherwise the series starts from the very beginning.

The articles lean towards Spectrum games development, and they are designed to
be read in sequence:


| Article         | Covers        |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| [Getting Started](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_01_GettingStarted.md) | The Z88DK toolset, compiler command line |
| [Hello World](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_02_HelloWorld.md)     | Text, stdio, CRTs |
| [Simple Graphics](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_03_SimpleGraphics.md) | Simple graphics, screen addressing, line drawing example |
| [Input Devices](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_04_InputDevices.md)   | Keyboard, scancodes, joysticks |
| [Multiple Files](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_05_MultipleFiles.md)  | Multiple file builds, list files |
| [Some Details](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_06_SomeDetails.md)    | Memory map, pragmas |

| [Interrupts](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_08_Interrupts.md) | Z80 Mode 2 interrupts |

A complementary series of documents covers the SP1 sprite library, which is
an excellent basis for Spectrum games written with Z88DK:

| Article         | Covers        |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| [SP1, Getting Started](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk/blob/master/doc/ZXSpectrumZSDCCnewlib_SP1_01_GettingStarted.md) | Getting started with SP1 |

These documents are a work in progress. Comments and suggestions are welcome in
the [Z88DK Sinclair ZX forum](https://www.z88dk.org/forum/viewforum.php?id=2).
